Soldering station for use with Weller RT tips. Hardware is based on 
https://github.com/ConnyCola/SolderingStation, with a different TFT screen
and a rotary encoder instead of a potentiometer. Software implements PID control,
remote temperature monitoring and a simple menu bar.

The Matlab folder contains a remote client written in Matlab.

Hardware schematics and PCB design can be found at https://easyeda.com/gmcoelho/rt-soldering-station.
Version 1.1 should be used with the software in this repository.
